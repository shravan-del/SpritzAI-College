Elective_Classes
"

    Hey Hokies, it's just about time for course request and I know people are searching for some easy classes to add to their schedule. In an attempt to minimize the need for posts asking about said classes, I made a program to skim all the 1XXX/2XXX/3XXX courses VT has offered over the last few years and compile a list of the ones that have a high average GPA (3.7+) over a large sample size (75+ students). Check it out below.
  
    The number in parenthesis is the average GPA for one of the recent sections offered. Please note that some of these classes may require prerequisites. Also, some inclusions on this list may be an artifact of an unusually high section grade (i.e. CS 2505 having a GPA of 3.78 in one section when it's usually much lower). I've removed a few of these cases but let me know if there are more. If anybody is interested in the Java code so they can play with it or generate their own lists shoot me a DM.
