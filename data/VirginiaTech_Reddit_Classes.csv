Virginia Tech has the following in their grade policy:\n\nA grade of ""I"" (incomplete) may be given when the requirements of a course other than the final examination have not been completed due to illness or extenuating circumstances beyond the student\'s control. The ""I"" grade is the prerogative of the instructor. To remove an ""I"" grade, lecture course requirements must be satisfied during the student\'s first subsequent term of enrollment, and laboratory course requirements must be satisfied prior to the end of the first term during which the course is offered and the student is enrolled. Incomplete and ""X"" grades are automatically converted to ""F"" if requirements are not fully satisfied during the period of time allowed.\n\nConsider asking your academic advisor for advice - he/she has likely had to assist at least one student experiencing something similar and would have the benefit of knowing how well (or not) the any accommodation worked for said student.  Agree with another comment about checking in with your dean too.  If you intend to take classes once the semester begins (rather than a leave of absence), reach out to each professor ahead of time to discuss your options if, in the event you need to miss class or leave indefinitely once the semester has begun.

They won’t tell them details, just that you’re going through something\n2) Contact your Professors: Make sure you have a plan for success. This is an extremely difficult and stressful situation, I’d urge you to be transparent in terms of what you can handle when it comes to due dates and whatnot\n3) Really tune in and try to understand what you can handle: For me personally, I thought with my situation I’d be able to handle school, my mother being extremely sick and work. Don’t overwork yourself or you’ll be burnt out. If it comes to the point where you need to take a semester off, I’d say to consider it so you wouldn’t need to be in school even longer because your head isn’t in it. That’s absolutely fine. You don’t want to pay for another semester/year(s) because you were out of it mentally. \n4) LEAVE A PAPER TRAIL: I URGE THIS. Make sure any type of document to back you up is kept and ready to be presented if need be. In the case you need academic relief these will help your process a lot more. Keep them in one place so you can find them later in case you need them\n5) Take to your counselors: Talk to your academic counselor and possibly utilize cook. I always heard about cook being ass but I went because both doctors and counselors on my mom’s case heavily advised me to, and I can say it genuinely helped. Look for Justin if you can, he specializes in grief and he’s AWESOME. \n6) Try to take it easy: I was a sophomore also and refused to give myself leeway in my situation and I genuinely regret that. I was terrified of not finishing school when I was supposed to and ended up stressing myself even more to the point of burnout and I literally couldn’t do anything. Couldn’t get up, go to class, barely could go to work but I would travel to see my mom which made me even more depressed as time progressed. This is going to be hard. I wish it wasn’t but it will be. I really wish you luck to you and your family and I’m incredibly sorry you’re going through this.

At least in most of my discussions and experiences it’s more about professors finding that people like the online access better and it being more convenient all around—especially given the pre-developed homework. it just so happens that publishers managed to cash in on the fact that you don’t have a physical copy in your hand. It’s the way of the world it seems, look at office products or adobe products as well. \n\nsome other things to keep in mind are definitely your point about forced curriculum, negotiated textbooks and prices for things such as engineering calculus or physics. I know in my moms case (instructor at another university) they negotiated that their textbook would be offered to their students at less than $120, otherwise they wouldn’t be publishing with the publisher that they went with, so probably a lot of it is just laziness or lack of understanding and want to negotiate with publishers on book deals. To counter that though some professors want a specific textbook because it is the best one, if the book rep knows that you have a hard time negotiating. \n\n\nkinda rambling here but that’s just how I understand things to be.', 'Let your instructor know you’d prefer free or low cost textbooks and that a wealth of [open educational resources ](https://guides.lib.vt.edu/c.php?g=10479&p=53700) exist.

Like how ms office and adobe started their own software as a service trend where you no longer own the software, publishers are trying to do the same thing. This has been the trend the industry has been moving towards with the new edition every year, access codes only included with the text and more to try and kill off piracy and the used book market. After all, the publishers don\'t get money from second hand sales. \n\nOn the professor side of things it\'s either laziness of lobbying as to why they use it. It is a well put together program and the professors don\'t need to put any effort in to make homework as it\'s all put together in a neat little ecosystem. Pearson(leading the education as a service charge) also lobbies colleges heavily marketing their products so if the department as a whole is on the system there\'s not much a professor can do (not sure if this is the case here but I know it is at some universities).\n\nSo I would absolutely love it if universities went back to keeping a textbook until the information gets outdated and the new version actually has meaningful changes. You can\'t tell me something like calc to needs a new book revision every year. I would love to buy a textbook second hand without worrying about access codes or if version 22 is correct or if it\'ll be version 23 this year. In high school I was able to buy science textbooks for 40 dollars second hand then sell them for the same price at the end of the year and that worked... for everyone but the publisher who didn\'t get a piece of the pie.

As an undergrad, I couldn\'t stand things like Wiley, MasteringPhysics, etc. in my lower-level classes and had the exact same qualms as everyone else in this thread. Professors using online HW platforms seemed lazy. But I\'ve been a GTA for a 400+ person intro class for a few years now and my perspective has flipped. I honestly believe many large intro classes use online textbook+HW packages not because the teaching staff is lazy but because there isn\'t enough time and/or manpower to manually grade everyone\'s HW.  \n  \nMy 400+ person class has a grand total of 3 instructional staff (2 GTAs and the instructor of record). Normally, we\'d have more GTAs but due to COVID, I don\'t think the department can afford to hire more. We\'re using a free online textbook and writing custom HWs instead of adopting some paid BS Pearson/Cengage/Wiley platform. We only select 1 of the ~5-6 problems on each HW to grade, but even that takes weeks. We\'ve scaled down the # of HWs significantly because if we assigned HWs every week, students wouldn\'t get their grades back until 2022.  \n  \nObviously, this didn\'t sit well with students, so we also assign ""weekly mini HWs"" which are submitted to a free automated grading platform (like WebCat for you CS people). We believe this is the best of both worlds: students submit low-stakes weekly assignments and get the instant feedback + unlimited access to practice problems they need and also occasionally submit longer, more substantial, and more meaningful high-stakes HWs at the cost of not knowing how they did until much later. And even with the automated grading platform, it still takes ages to process/filter/curve/verify scores.   \n  \nThe underlying problem is all the tuition, fees, etc. students pay still isn\'t enough to cover the cost of additional manpower necessary to administer and grade custom HWs. Companies like Pearson and Wiley are taking advantage of this and your money is going to them for providing a service VT just can\'t offer. Does it suck?

I am an Engineering Student, specifically ECE, so I need both courses, but I am also doing a Math Minor, so take that for what you will. I took Linear, Multi and Physics 1 all at the same time, and I firmly believe that taking both Linear and Multi at the same time is not only doable, but also a good idea.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFirst, they both start at the same point, which is Vectors and Planes. Where Multi discusses stuff like Constructing Planes from Vectors, defining Planes and vectors, as well as Parametric curves and the Cross product, Linear will start off with things like Dot product, Properties of Vectors and Vector Arithmetic. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThen Multi will move to firmly Calculus based material, like Triple Integrals, Alternate Coordinate Systems, and Applications, whereas Multi will go into Subspaces, Null Spaces, Determinants, Eigenstuff and Diagonalization. This is to say, they diverge heavily, but that is a good thing because at this point, you are using tools in Multi that are made with Linear, so they click back together. For example, you start using the Cross Product pretty early in Multi to find something called Orthogonal Vectors. It isnt until later in Linear that you learn that the Cross product formula you learn, is an extension of something called Laplacian Expansion, which has to do with determinants, and when i found this linkage, it blew my mind because it unlocked a whole new perspective for me.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThen we come back a bit. Multi at VT does not cover Vectro Calculus, but it prepares you for ti with things like Gradients, Space Curves, and more Vectors, whereas Linear will transition back to more simpler stuff to things like Gram-Schmidt Orthonormalization. This is important, because by this point, Linear is starting to reconstruct more of the tools you use in Multi, while at the same time, having the understanding of Linear when you hit the latter half of Multi really helps understand things, especially when it comes to something called Lagrange Multipliers, which can be extended to n Dimensions.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI took Physics at the same time, and when we started to hit things liek rotational kinematics, we learned *about* the application of the Cross product, and you get a physical understanding for it. Physics II becomes so much easier with Multi (even though they are not pre-reqs) because things are written in terms of Double Integrals, and Phsyics II is actually defined in terms of Vector Calculus, which if you choose to learn on your own, needs a good understanding of both Linear *AND* Multi.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTL;DR It is not only very much doable, but they interlink in ways that not only clarify and explain things, but also show how they work in the Physical World', 'Multi is a tough class at VT.

There’s also a study abroad through the honors college that’s really nice (I was accepted to it but didn’t get to go because of covid unfortunately) the cons are that the honors college is still fairly new so there’s somethings that could be better as well as the honors diploma can be hard to actually complete. I’m graduating early so I’m not going to be able to get the honors diploma but I’ll still have been part of the honors college for three years and having priority placement for classes was worth it in my opinion.
